I wrote my final thesis to investigate Supply Chain Risk Management During Global Crisis of Walmart during the Pandemic. 
The 2020 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in many companies' SCRM strategies, leading to closures,
but Walmart Inc. demonstrated resilience, increasing revenue and customer reputation, highlighting the
importance of effective SCRM strategies.

This study examines Walmart's SCRM strategy during COVID-19, emphasising its critical importance
through an analysis of Walmart's financial reports and press releases, and exploring how investments in
e-commerce, technology, and other SCRM practices led to sales growth and reinforced community
trust and resilience. The methodology involves a review of secondary data, including financials, capital
expenditures, operating cash flow, and investments.
