I wrote my final thesis to investigate Supply Chain Risk Management During Global Crisis of Walmart during the Pandemic. 
The 2020 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in many companies' SCRM strategies, leading to closures,
but Walmart Inc. demonstrated resilience, increasing revenue and customer reputation, highlighting the
importance of effective SCRM strategies.

This study examines Walmart's SCRM strategy during COVID-19, emphasising its critical importance
through an analysis of Walmart's financial reports and press releases, and exploring how investments in
e-commerce, technology, and other SCRM practices led to sales growth and reinforced community
trust and resilience. The methodology involves a review of secondary data, including financials, capital
expenditures, operating cash flow, and investments.

Key points:

> Net Sales (US) is represented by the blue line.

> Net Sales (International) is represented by the orange line.

> The sales values are in billions of dollars.

2020: US net sales were $341 billion, and international net sales were $120 billion.

2021: US net sales increased to $370 billion, while international net sales slightly increased to $121 billion.

2022: US net sales rose to $393 billion, whereas international net sales decreased to $100 billion.

2023: US net sales further increased to $421 billion, with international net sales marginally increasing to $101 billion.

The graph demonstrates a consistent growth in Walmart's US net sales over the four-year period, while international net sales show a slight decline and then a minor increase towards the end of the period.



2)  The graph below represents Walmart's Operating Cash Flow in billions of dollars and Revenue Growth in percentage from the years 2019 to 2023.

 Key points:

> Operating Cash Flow is shown with blue bars.
 
> Revenue Growth is shown with green bars.

> For each year:

2023: Operating Cash Flow is 28.8 billion dollars with a Revenue Growth of 6.7%.

2022: Operating Cash Flow is 24.2 billion dollars with a Revenue Growth of 2.3%.

2021: Operating Cash Flow is 36.1 billion dollars with a Revenue Growth of 6.8%.

2020: Operating Cash Flow is 25.3 billion dollars with a Revenue Growth of 1.9%.

2019: Operating Cash Flow is 27.8 billion dollars with a Revenue Growth of 2.9%.

The graph illustrates the relationship between Walmart's operating cash flow and its revenue growth over the five-year period, showing fluctuations in both metrics.
